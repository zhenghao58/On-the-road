##Pay attention to

	when you finish your work,and want to commit and push your code to github, please do not commit all files you have modified and without comment.I will recommend you to commit your work group by function. each time you do commit,just commit the files with one function of app,and with some necessary comment with it.
	
##When you are coding

	Please add some comment for your code if you think it's necessary, like some function you think you have to describe your mind of what your write. the most advantage is the comments can let people read your code more easily.
